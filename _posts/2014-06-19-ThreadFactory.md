java threadFacotry接口，可以避免对线程的hard writing,比如

{% highlight java%}
    Thread t=new Thread(new Runnable(){
            do someting...
        });
{% endhighlight%}


*可以指定thread的优先级等*

{% highlight java %}
package java.util.concurrent;

/**
 * An object that creates new threads on demand.  Using thread factories
 * removes hardwiring of calls to {@link Thread#Thread(Runnable) new Thread},
 * enabling applications to use special thread subclasses, priorities, etc.
 *
 * <p>
 * The simplest implementation of this interface is just:
 * <pre>
 * class SimpleThreadFactory implements ThreadFactory {
 *   public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
 *     return new Thread(r);
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The {@link Executors#defaultThreadFactory} method provides a more
 * useful simple implementation, that sets the created thread context
 * to known values before returning it.
 * @since 1.5

public interface ThreadFactory {

    /**
     * Constructs a new {@code Thread}.  Implementations may also initialize
     * priority, name, daemon status, {@code ThreadGroup}, etc.
     *
     * @param r a runnable to be executed by new thread instance
     * @return constructed thread, or {@code null} if the request to
     *         create a thread is rejected
     */
    Thread newThread(Runnable r);
}
